= Crosshair Layer

== Topic Overview

=== Purpose

This topic provides information about the crosshair layer used for hover interactions. It describes the properties of the crosshair layer and provides an implementation example.

=== Required background

The following topics are prerequisites to understanding this topic:

|Topic|Purpose

| link:datachart-getting-started-with-datachart.html[Getting Started with Data Chart]
|The _{DataChartName}_ control requires a data object model to be mapped to control's DataContext property. This article will provide a simple data object model but you can create your own and use it with this sample code instead.

| link:datachart-category-series-overview.html[Category Series]
|This topic explains various types of Category Series in the _{DataChartName}_ control.

[[Overview]]
== Overview

=== Crosshair layer overview

The link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer_members.html[CrosshairLayer] renders as crossing lines intersecting at the actual value of every series that they are configured to target with each series rendering a separate set of lines.

You can configure the link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer_members.html[CrosshairLayer] so that the layer will only display one specific series as by default they target all series on the  _{DataChartName}_  control. To achieve this, set the link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer{ApiProp}targetseries.html[TargetSeries] property. For more information on this property, see the <<Properties,Properties>> section below.

By default, the color of the crosshair lines is a lighter color than the series that it is interacting with. However, this default setting can be overridden so that you can select a color that will be used for the crosshair lines. This is done by setting the link:{DataChartLink}.series{ApiProp}brush.html[Brush] property. For more information on this property see the link:datachart-commonproperties.html[Common Properties] topic.

[[Preview]]

=== Preview

The following image is a preview of the  _{DataChartName}_  control rendered with the link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer_members.html[CrosshairLayer] added.

=== Crosshair layer properties

The following table summarizes the properties of the crosshair layer.

|Property Name|Property Type|Description

| pick:[xaml,win-forms=" link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer{ApiProp}horizontallinevisibility.html[HorizontalLineVisibility]"] pick:[android=" link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer{ApiProp}ishorizontallinevisible.html[setIsHorizontalLineVisible]"] 
|
ifdef::xaml,win-forms[] 

Visibility 

endif::xaml,win-forms[] 

ifdef::android[] 

bool 

endif::android[]
|This property specifies if the horizontal line of the crosshair layer should be visible.

| pick:[xaml,win-forms=" link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer{ApiProp}verticallinevisibility.html[VerticalLineVisibility]"] pick:[android=" link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer{ApiProp}isverticallinevisible.html[setIsVerticalLineVisible]"] 
|
ifdef::xaml,win-forms[] 

Visibility 

endif::xaml,win-forms[] 

ifdef::android[] 

bool 

endif::android[]
|This property specifies if the vertical line of the crosshair layer should be visible.

| link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer{ApiProp}targetseries.html[TargetSeries]
|Series
|This property specifies which series should have an enabled crosshair layer. 

It is possible to create a separate crosshair layer for each series and configure them individually.

| link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer{ApiProp}useinterpolation.html[UseInterpolation]
|bool
|This property specifies if the vertical crosshair should cross the series at an interpolated position between data points. Usually the crosshair layer finds the closest point in a series and ensures that the crosshairs meet at that point, however if the points are sparse then you should enable this property.

ifdef::xaml,win-forms[]

|link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer{ApiProp}isaxisannotationenabled.html[IsAxisAnnotationEnabled]
|bool
|This property specifies whether to draw annotations over the axes where the crosshair meets with them.

endif::xaml,win-forms[]

=== Example

The following screenshot illustrates how the {DataChartName} control with the link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer{ApiProp}targetseries.html[TargetSeries] property of the link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer_members.html[CrosshairLayer] object looks configured using the following setting:

Following is the code used in this implementation

ifdef::wpf,win-universal[]

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:CrosshairLayer 
   TargetSeries="{Binding ElementName=series1}"
/>
----

endif::wpf,win-universal[]

ifdef::wpf,win-forms[]

*In C#:*

----
var crosshairLayerSeries = new CrossHairLightLayer();
crosshairLayerSeries.TargetSeries = series1;
chart.Series.Add(crosshairLayerSeries);
----

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Dim crosshairLayerSeries As new CrossHairLightLayer()
crosshairLayerSeries.TargetSeries = series1
chart.Series.Add(crosshairLayerSeries)
----

endif::wpf,win-forms[]

ifdef::xamarin[]

*In C#:*

----
var crosshairLayerSeries = new CrossHairLightLayer();
crosshairLayerSeries.TargetSeries = series1;
chart.Series.Add(crosshairLayerSeries);
