=== Application Requirements

The following table lists requirements for creating the  _{DataChartName}_   control.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Requirement|Description

|Install Infragistics product
|The chart control is part of Infragistics product

|Data Source
|The chart control requires some data source and this topic provides link:resources-sample-energy-data.html[Sample Energy Data] as sample data source. You can use this data source or add your own data. Refer to link:datachart-series-requirements.html[Series Requirements] topic for information on requirements of all types of chart series.

|====

[[_Ref397371278]]

=== Chart Requirements

The chart control supports various types of data visualizations called Series. These series objects can visualize wide range of data source. Refer to the link:datachart-series-types.html[Series Types] topic for complete list of series supported in the chart control. Each type of series can plot data that meets certain requirements (such as number of data column and their types) as well as what type of axis can be used with it. Refer to the link:datachart-series-requirements.html[Series Requirements] topic for requirements for each of the series.

For demonstration purpose, this topic uses link:resources-sample-energy-data.html[Sample Energy Data] with only one link:{DataChartLink}.areaseries.html[AreaSeries] and two axes: CategoryXAxis and NumericYAxis.

[[_Ref396236025]]

=== Creating Application

Create {PlatformName} application project in the Microsoft® Blend.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
You don’t need to add any references to Infragistics components because they will be added automatically when you drag and drop Infragistics DataChart control to designer surface.
====

[[_Ref396236029]]

=== Creating Data Source

Copy sample data code from the link:resources-sample-energy-data.html[Sample Energy Data] resource and add it to your project.
