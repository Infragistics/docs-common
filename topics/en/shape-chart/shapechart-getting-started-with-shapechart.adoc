[[Requirements]]
== Requirements

ifdef::wpf[]

Add the following NuGet package to your application:

** Infragistics.WPF.Charts

For more information on setting up the NuGet feed and adding NuGet packages, you can take a look at the following documentation: link:nuget-feeds.html[NuGet Feeds].

endif::wpf[]

ifdef::win-forms[]

Add the following Infragistics assembly references to your application:

** {ApiPlatform}{ShapeChartAssembly}.dll
** {ApiPlatform}{DataVizAssembly}.dll
** {ApiPlatform}dll

endif::win-forms[]

ifdef::wpf[]
*In XAML:*
[source,xaml]
----
xmlns:ig="http://schemas.infragistics.com/xaml"
----
endif::wpf[]

*In C#:*
[source,csharp]
----
using {ShapeChartNamespace};
----

ifdef::wpf,win-forms[]
*In VB:*
[source,vb]
----
Imports {ShapeChartNamespace}
----
endif::wpf,win-forms[]


[[Steps]]
== Adding the {ShapeChartName} to the {PlatformName} application

=== 1. Add the {ShapeChartName} to the page.

The following code demonstrates adding the {ShapeChartName} control with the minimal code and property settings required for display. The below code uses the link:resources-sample-scatter-data.html[Sample Scatter Data] resource.

ifdef::wpf[]
*In XAML:*
[source,xaml]
----
<Grid x:Name="layoutRoot">
    <ig:{ShapeChartName} ItemsSource="{Binding DataCollection}" />
</Grid>
----
endif::wpf[]

*In C#:*
[source,csharp]
----
var data = new ScatterDataSource();
var shapeChart = new {ShapeChartName}();
shapeChart.ItemsSource = data;
this.layoutRoot.Children.Add(shapeChart);
----

ifdef::wpf,win-forms[]
*In VB:*
[source,vb]
----
Dim data As New ScatterDataSource()
Dim shapeChart As New {ShapeChartName}()
shapeChart.ItemsSource = data
Me.layoutRoot.Children.Add(shapeChart)
----
endif::wpf,win-forms[]


=== 2. Verify the results.

Build and run your project to verify the result. If you have implemented the steps correctly, the displayed {ShapeChartName} should look like the one in the Preview section above.
