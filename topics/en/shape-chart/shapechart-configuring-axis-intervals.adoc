= Axis Intervals

=== Purpose
This topic demonstrates how to configure the major and minor intervals for chart axes of the link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartName}.html[{ShapeChartName}] control. 

In the {ShapeChartName} control, axis major interval specifies how frequent major gridlines and axis labels are rendered on an axis. Similarly, axis minor interval specifies how frequent minor gridlines are rendered on an axis.

|The frequency of major interval gridlines	
|link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartCartesian}{ApiProp}XAxisInterval.html[XAxisInterval] +
link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartCartesian}{ApiProp}YAxisInterval.html[YAxisInterval] 	
|This value provides configurable spacing for axis labels and major gridlines. Note that the interval for axis labels will also be set by this value, displaying one label at the point on the axis associated with the interval.

On the {ShapeChartName} control's axes, this value is represented as double between axis minimum value and axis maximum value. By default, these axes will automatically calculate and find a nice and round interval based on axis minimum values and maximum value.

|The color of the major interval gridlines

|A color of axis major gridlines.
|The thickness of the major interval gridlines	
|link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartXY}{ApiProp}XAxisMajorStrokeThickness.html[XAxisMajorStrokeThickness] +
link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartXY}{ApiProp}YAxisMajorStrokeThickness.html[YAxisMajorStrokeThickness]	
|A thickness in pixels of the axis major gridline stroke set as a double value.
|The frequency of minor interval gridlines	
|link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartCartesian}{ApiProp}XAxisMinorInterval.html[XAxisMinorInterval] +
link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartCartesian}{ApiProp}YAxisMinorInterval.html[YAxisMinorInterval]	
|This value provides configurable spacing for minor gridlines, which are always rendered between major gridlines. As result, a value of XAxisMinorInterval property should always be much smaller (usually 2-5 time smaller) than the value of XAxisInterval property of an axis.

This value is represented as a double between axis minimum value and axis maximum value. By default, numeric axes will not automatically calculate minor interval based on axis minimum values and maximum value.
