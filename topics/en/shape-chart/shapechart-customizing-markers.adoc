= Configuring Chart Markers

Markers are visual elements that are displayed at the values of data points in the link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartName}.html[{ShapeChartName}] control's plot area. Markers help your end-users immediately identify a data point's value even if the value falls between major or minor grid lines.
This section provides you with useful information about working with the {ShapeChartName} control's Markers.

|Topic|Purpose

|link:shapechart-overview.html[{ShapeChartName} Overview]
|This topic provides conceptual information about the {ShapeChartName} control including its main features, minimum requirements, and user functionality.

|link:shapechart-getting-started-with-shapechart.html[Getting Started with {ShapeChartName}]
|This topic explains how to bind data to the {ShapeChartName} control.

[[supportedcharttypes]]
== Supported Chart Types

The following is a list of chart types that support markers:

* Bubble 
* Line
* Point
* Polygon
* Spline

Note, Polygon displays its markers in the center of the shapes, defined by points, whereas the other chart types render its markers at X/Y coordinates of data items. 

[[markerproperties]]
== Marker Properties

The following table lists all marker appearance properties.

|link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartDomain}{ApiProp}MarkerTypes.html[MarkerTypes]
|link:{ShapeChartLink}.MarkerTypeCollection.html[MarkerTypeCollection]
|Determines the type of markers to be displayed by all series in the chart

|link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartDomain}{ApiProp}MarkerCollision.html[MarkerCollision]
|link:{ShapeChartLink}.CollisionAvoidanceType.html[CollisionAvoidanceType]
|Determines the method of collision avoidance when items collide.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to change the marker type for all series in the {ShapeChartName}.
ifdef::wpf[]
*In XAML:*
[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamShapeChart 
    ItemsSource="{Binding}" 
    ChartType="Spline" 
    MarkerTypes="Triangle" 
</ig:XamShapeChart>
----
endif::wpf[]

ifdef::wpf[]
*In C#:*
[source,csharp]
----
this.shapeChart.MarkerTypes = new Infragistics.Controls.Charts.MarkerTypeCollection 
{ 
    MarkerType.Triangle 
};
----

*In Visual Basic:*
[source,vb]
----
Me.shapeChart.MarkerTypes = New Infragistics.Controls.Charts.MarkerTypeCollection From 
{
    MarkerType.Triangle
}
----
endif::win-forms[] 

The following screenshot displays the {ShapeChartName} control using the Spline chart type with Triangle markers.

[[markerappearance]]
== Marker Appearance

The appearance of chart markers is managed through the link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartDomain}{ApiProp}MarkerBrushes.html[MarkerBrushes] and link:{ShapeChartLink}.{ShapeChartDomain}{ApiProp}MarkerBrushes.html[MarkerOutlines] properties of the {ShapeChartName} class.

The code snippets below demonstrates how to change the MarkerBrushes and MarkerOutlines for the {ShapeChartName}. 

ifdef::wpf[]
*In XAML:*
[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamShapeChart 
      MarkerBrushes=”Red Blue” 
      MarkerOutlines=”Red Blue”
      ChartType="Line">
</ig:XamCategoryChart>

----



*In C#:*
[source,csharp]
----
shapeChart.MarkerBrushes = new BrushCollection 
{ 
    Brushes.Red, 
    Brushes.Blue 
};
shapeChart.MarkerOutlines = new BrushCollection 
{ 
    Brushes.Red, 
    Brushes.Blue 
};
----

*In Visual Basic:*
[source,vb]
----
Me.shapeChart.MarkerBrushes = New BrushCollection From 
{
    Brushes.Red, 
    Brushes.Blue
}
Me.shapeChart.MarkerOutlines = New BrushCollection From 
{
    Brushes.Red, 
    Brushes.Blue
}
----
endif::wpf[] 

The following screenshot displays the {ShapeChartName} control using the Line chart type with customized markers.
