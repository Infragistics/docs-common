=== Optical Scaling overview

The gauge size, labels and titles are visual elements that can change it's scaling. To enable this, first set link:{RadialGaugeLink}.{RadialGaugeRange}{ApiProp}OpticalScalingEnabled.html[OpticalScalingEnabled] to true. Then you can set link:{RadialGaugeLink}.{RadialGaugeRange}{ApiProp}OpticalScalingSize.html[OpticalScalingSize] which manages the size at which labels have 100% optical scaling. Labels will have larger fonts when gauge's size is larger. For example, labels will have a 200% larger font size when this property is set to 500 and the gauge px size is doubled to eg. 1000.
