[[Intro]]
== Introduction

Using link:{SpreadsheetLink}.{SpreadsheetName}~chartadapter.html[ChartAdapter] you can display the charts in the spreadsheet.The spreadsheet chart adapters creates and initializes chart elements for the spreadsheet based on a Infragistics.Documents.Excel.WorksheetChart instance.

In order to add a `WorksheetChart` to a worksheet, you must use the link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheetshapecollection{ApiProp}addchart.html[AddChart] method of the worksheet's Shapes collection.You can find more detail of adding charts in Excel pick:[xaml=" link:excelengine-adding-a-chart-to-an-excel-worksheet.html[here]"]

Here are the steps by step description :

1.	Add the SpreadsheetChartAdapter assembly reference to your project 
2.	Create an instance of a SpreadsheetChartAdapter class
3.	Assign the chart adapter instance created in step 2 to the Spreadsheet's Chart Adapter property
4.	Run your app and load a worksheet containing a chart
