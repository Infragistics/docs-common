= Known Issues and Limitations in BulletGraph

== Known Issues and Limitations

=== Overview

The following table summarizes the known issues and limitations of the _{BulletGraphName}_ control. Detailed explanations of known issues and the possible workarounds are provided for some of the issues in the following summary table.

|Issue|Description|Status

|<<_SingleCMAndPB,Only one performance bar and one comparative marker supported>>
|The _{BulletGraphName}_ control supports only one performance bar and one comparative marker.
|image::images/Known_Issues_and_Limitations_Solution.png[]

|<<_NoLabelsCollision,No label collisions detection>>
|The _{BulletGraphName}_ control does not provide means for detecting label collisions. As a result, when the space to visualize the labels is not sufficient, label collisions may occur.

|Performance bar can be drawn only from the minimum scale position
|The starting position of the performance bar can only be at the minimum value of the scale, i.e. the performance bar cannot originate from an arbitrary position.

[[_Ref367479792]]
== _{BulletGraphName}_

[[_SingleCMAndPB]]

=== Only one performance bar and one comparative marker supported

The _{BulletGraphName}_ control supports only one performance bar and one comparative marker.

.Workaround
[NOTE]
====
The effect of displaying multiple performance bars or multiple comparative markers can be achieved by overlaying several instances of the the Bullet Graph control with transparent background.
====

[[_NoLabelsCollision]]

=== No label collisions detection

The _{BulletGraphName}_ control does not provide means for detecting label collisions. As a result, when the space to visualize the labels is not sufficient, label collisions may occur.

.Workaround
[NOTE]
====
Make sure that in the container of the control there is sufficient space to display the labels properly.
