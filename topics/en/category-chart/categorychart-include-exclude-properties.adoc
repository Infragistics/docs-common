[[propertysettings]]
== Property Settings

You can include and exclude properties from the {CategoryChartName} by setting the following properties:

|===
|Property Name|Property Type|Description

|link:{CategoryChartLink}.{CategoryChartDomain}{ApiProp}includedproperties.html[IncludedProperties]
|`string[]`
|Gets or sets a set of property paths that should be included for consideration by the chart, leaving the remainder excluded. If null, all properties will be considered.

|link:{CategoryChartLink}.{CategoryChartDomain}{ApiProp}excludedproperties.html[ExcludedProperties]
|`string[]`
|Gets or sets a set of property paths that should be excluded from consideration by the chart. The complex expressions can be used, for example to exclude a property in a sub-collection ,use wildcards such *.<propertyName> to exclude [0].<propertyName> , [1].<propertyName> and so on.

The following code example uses the link:resources-sample-energy-data.html[Energy Data Source] sample code as its pick:[win-forms="DataSource"]pick:[sl,wpf,win-phone,win-universal,xamarin="ItemsSource"] and shows how to achieve the following chart both by including and excluding properties.
