= Chart Types

== Overview

In order to select how data should be displayed it is enough to set the link:{CategoryChartLink}.{CategoryChartName}{ApiProp}ChartType.html[ChartType] property of this chart.
Below are all of the types that the Category Chart supports.

Special case is the `Auto` setting of that property. If `Auto` is used the chart will analyze assigned data and will assign the most suitable chart type.

The default value of that property is determined by the size of the underlying ItemsSource bound to the category chart. If a small data set is provided, the default value is `Column` while if a larger data set is provided, the default value is `Line.`
