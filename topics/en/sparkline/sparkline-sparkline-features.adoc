[[Introduction]]

== Introduction

=== Introduction to the {SparklineName} visual elements and features

The  _{SparklineName}_   control has several visual elements and corresponding features through which these elements can be configured and customized. The primary benefit of Sparkline compared to other charting controls is that it can render in a limited space such as a grid cell with all its visual elements shown. With that in mind, the Sparkline cannot display every label of the data points. It only allows showing high and low values on Y axis, and first and last values on X axis.

The Sparkline has the ability to mark the data points with elliptical icons to indicate the highest, lowest, first, last and negative values. The markers can be customized with a desired
ifdef::wpf,sl[]
shape, color or image.
endif::wpf,sl[]
ifdef::xamarin[]
shape or color.
endif::xamarin[]

It allows displaying the (X/Y) axis, which takes up the space from the chart by decreasing the chart size in order to accommodate area for the axis and labels.

[[Trend_Lines]]
== Trend Line

[[_Ref318913575]]

=== Trend Line overview

Trend lines are lines drawn from the starting point to the end point indicating the trending direction and movement of the series, so that the viewer can evaluate the tendencies in the data and mentally extrapolate past, future, or unknown values.

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_13.png[]

The Trend Line feature enables you to choose among several formulas for generating a trending directional line. The formula to use is specified in the link:{SparklineLink}.{SparklineName}{ApiProp}trendlinetype.html[TrendLineType] property. The Trend Line renders in front of the series data so it is always visible.

[[_Ref318913584]]

=== Supported trend line types

The following table displays the supported trend line types. Each trend line type is drawn based on the calculation formula of its type.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|*Trend Line type*|*Description*| link:sparkline-sparkline-property-reference.html#TrendLineType[TrendLineType]

|Simple Average

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_14.png[]
|SimpleAverage is a set of numbers, each of which is the average of a corresponding subset of data points. Also known as Simple Moving Average
|_SimpleAverage_

|Modified Average

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_15.png[]
|Modified Average shows the moving average value over a set period. Used to emphasize the direction of the trend and smooth out the fluctuation.
|_ModifiedAverage_

|Exponential Average

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_16.png[]
|Exponental Average is similar to simple average with weight factor added to it. This type of average is known to react faster to recent changes of the trend.
| _ExponentialAverage_ 

|Cumulative Average

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_17.png[]
|Cumulative Average is an ordered data points with calculated average of all data up to the current point.
| _CumulativeAverage_ 

|Weighted Average

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_18.png[]
|Weighted Average is any average that has multiplying factor to give weight to data at different positions.
| _WeightedAverage_ 

|Cubic Fit

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_19.png[]
|Uses polynomial mathematical functions to specify a cubic fit trend line on a series.
| _CubicFit_ 

|Exponential Fit

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_20.png[]
|Uses exponential mathematical functions to specify an exponential fit trend line on a series.
| _ExponentialFit_ 

|Line Fit

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_21.png[]
|The best-fiting straight trend line.
| _LineFit_ 

|Logarithmic Fit

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_22.png[]
|The best-fitting curved line. Used when the rate of change in the data increases or decreases quickly and then levels out. This type of trend line is most useful with sufficient data.
| _LogarithmicFit_ 

|Power Low Fit

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_23.png[]
|Power Low trend line is a curved line that uses power function to draw a line. It is best to avoid zero (0) point as it is not valid for power function. Sparkline will not produce any errors, it will plot the o point, but from the power trend line prospective the result will not be accurate. Power trend line is used with data sets that compare measurements that increase at a specific rate.
| _PowerLowFit_ 

|Quadratic Fit

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_24.png[]
|Uses quadratic equation to form a trend line. It shows the overall effect of the high and low data points with the accuracy of a linear curve.
| _QuadraticFit_ 

|Quartic Fit

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_25.png[]
|Uses quartic polynomial to specify a trend line on series.
| _QuarticFit_ 

|Quintic Fit

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_26.png[]
|Uses quintic polynomial to specify a trend line on a series.
| _QuinticFit_

[[Normal_Range]]
== Normal Range

=== Normal Range overview

The Normal Range is a horizontal stripe drawn to represent some pre-defined meaningful range when the data is being visualized.

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_4.png[]

The typical use of the Normal Range is to indicate what values are considered normal or good. For example, if the Sparkline represented the person’s heart rate over time, the normal range of 60-100 beats per minute would be the range to be highlighted as Normal, and the data points outside of this range would be easy to identify.

The range width and position is determined by the link:sparkline-sparkline-property-reference.html#NormalRangeMaximum[NormalRangeMinimum] and link:sparkline-sparkline-property-reference.html#NormalRangeMinimum[NormalRangeMaximum] properties.

[[Interpolating_Unknown_Values]]
== Interpolating Unknown Values

[[_Ref318913700]]

=== Interpolating Unknown Values overview

The  _{SparklineName}_   can detect unknown values and render the space for the unknown values using a specified interpolation algorithm.

If there are missing values in the data (typical “unknown” values found in data are  _null_   and  _double.NaN_  ),  _{SparklineName}_   can render in the space with unknown values by linear interpolation. The following table demonstrates the difference in a Sparkline plotted from the same data set (containing missing values) without using Unknown Values Plotting and with it.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|*Plotting of unknown values applied?*|*Preview*

|No
|image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_28.png[]

|Yes
|image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_29.png[]

|====

This feature is managed through the link:sparkline-sparkline-property-reference.html#UnknownValuePlotting[UnknownValuePlotting] property. The allowed values are  _DontPlot_   and  _LinearInterpolate_  .

[[_Ref318913707]]

=== Supported Sparkline types

The following Sparkline types support Unknown Values Plotting:

* Area
* Line

The Column and Win/Loss types do not interpolate unknown values. These Sparkline types will always display a blank space where unknown values are present.

==== Related Topics:

* link:sparkline-interpolating-unknown-values.html[Interpolating Unknown Values]

[[Axes]]
== Axes

[[_Ref318913728]]

=== Axes overview

The Sparkline allows displaying the X and Y axes (both or only one of them) with corresponding labels.

[cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_30.png[]
|image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_31.png[]
|image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_32.png[]

|====

[[_Ref318913738]]

=== Axes customization

The axes of the  _{SparklineName}_   control can be customized in the following aspects:

* Visibility

The visibility of the X and Y axis are managed by separate properties ( link:{SparklineLink}.{SparklineName}{ApiProp}horizontalaxisvisibility.html[HorizontalAxisVisibility] and link:{SparklineLink}.{SparklineName}{ApiProp}verticalaxisvisibility.html[VerticalAxisVisibility], respectively) so it is possible to have only one of them displayed.

* Label

** Label text

You can add descriptive labels to the X axis. This capability is managed by the link:sparkline-sparkline-property-reference.html#LabelMemberPath[LabelMemberPath] property.

* Label font

The label fonts can be customized using the typical font-related control properties: link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.foreground.aspx[Foreground], link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontfamily.aspx[FontFamily], link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontsize.aspx[FontSize], link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontstyle.aspx[FontStyle], and link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.fontstretch.aspx[FontStretch]. Therefore, it is not possible to use a different font for each axis.

[[Tooltips]]
== Tooltip

[[_Ref318913754]]

=== Tooltip overview

The  _{SparklineName}_   can display a tooltip when the mouse is hovered over the Sparkline. The tooltip is designed to display the high, low, first, and last data points.

image::images/Sparkline_Visual_Elements_33.png[]
ifdef::sl,wpf,win-phone,win-universal[]
Tooltips are managed by the link:sparkline-sparkline-property-reference.html#ToolTip[ToolTip] property.

[[_Ref318913762]]

=== Tooltip customization

The tooltips of the  _{SparklineName}_   can be customized in the following aspects:

* Label text
* Label font
* Label color
* Font size

For more information about customizing the tooltip refer to the link:sparkline-configuring-the-tooltip.html[Configuring the Tooltip] topic.
