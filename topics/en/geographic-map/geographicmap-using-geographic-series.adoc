=== Geographic Series Overview

In the _{GeoMapName}_ control, geographic series are visual elements of the map that display geo-spatial data as points (e.g. locations of cities), polylines (e.g. road connections), or polygons (shape of countries) in a geographic context.

The _{GeoMapName}_ control’s link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~series.html[Series] property is a collection of geographic series objects. This property is used to support rendering an unlimited number of geographic series in the same plot area (refer to the link:geographicmap-displaying-multiple-geographic-series.html[Displaying Multiple Geographic Series] topic). When multiple geographic series objects are added to the link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~series.html[Series] property, each successive series will be layered on top of the previous series starting from the first to the last series. Therefore, geographic series can be better understood as map layers that can be stacked on top of each other and/or on top of geographic imagery (refer to the link:geographicmap-using-geographic-imagery.html[Using Geographic Imagery] topic).

=== Types of Geographic Series

The following table summarizes types of geographic series supported in the _{GeoMapName}_ control.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]

| *Geographic Series* | *Preview* | *Description* 

|Geographic Shape Series
|image::images/GeographicMap_Using_Geographic_Series_1.png[]
|The link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseries_members.html[GeographicShapeSeries] displays geo-spatial data using polygons in a geographic context. This type of geographic series is often used to render shapes of countries or regions defined by geographic locations.

|Geographic Polyline Series
|image::images/GeographicMap_Using_Geographic_Series_2.png[]
|The link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicpolylineseries_members.html[GeographicPolylineSeries] displays geo-spatial data using polylines in a geographic context. This type of geographic series is often used to render roads or connections between geographic locations such as cities or airports.

|Geographic Symbol Series
|image::images/GeographicMap_Using_Geographic_Series_3.png[]
|The link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicsymbolseries_members.html[GeographicSymbolSeries] displays geo-spatial data using points or markers in a geographic context. This type of geographic series is often used to render a collection of geographic locations such as cities, airports, earthquakes, or points of interest.

The following is a list of topics which provide task-based information on using individual types of geographic series and their unique features in the _{GeoMapName}_ control.

* link:geographicmap-using-geographic-symbol-series.html[Using Geographic Symbol Series]
* link:geographicmap-using-geographic-polyline-series.html[Using Geographic Polyline Series]

All types of geographic series are always rendered on top of the geographic imagery tiles. However, sometimes geographic series (e.g. with detailed shape files of the world) might provide enough geographic contexts for an application and geographic imagery is not desired in the _{GeoMapName}_ control. Refer to the link:geographicmap-hiding-geographic-imagery-in-map-background-content.html[Hiding Geographic Imagery in Map Background Content] topic for information on how to hide the geographic imagery.

=== Example

The code shows how to add the link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseries_members.html[GeographicShapeSeries] with the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] binding to the _{GeoMapName}_ control.

ifdef::wpf[]
*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamGeographicMap x:Name="GeoMap">
    <ig:XamGeographicMap.Series>
        <ig:GeographicShapeSeries {ApiDataSource}="{StaticResource shapefileConverter}"
                                   ShapeMemberPath="Points">
        </ig:GeographicShapeSeries>
    </ig:XamGeographicMap.Series>
</ig:XamGeographicMap>
----
endif::wpf[]

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
' create and set data binding to the GeographicShapeSeries
Dim geoSeries = New GeographicShapeSeries()
geoSeries.{ApiDataSource} = shapefileConverter
geoSeries.ShapeMemberPath = "Points"
' add the GeographicShapeSeries to the the {GeoMapName}
Me.GeoMap.Series.Add(geoSeries)
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
// create and set data binding to the GeographicShapeSeries
var geoSeries = new GeographicShapeSeries();
geoSeries.{ApiDataSource} = shapefileConverter;
geoSeries.ShapeMemberPath = "Points";
// add the GeographicShapeSeries to the the {GeoMapName}
this.GeoMap.Series.Add(geoSeries);
