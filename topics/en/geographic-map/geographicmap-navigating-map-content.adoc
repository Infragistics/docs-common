== Map Navigation

=== Overview

The _{GeoMapName}_ control inherits navigation functionalities from link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer_members.html[SeriesViewer] control which is also used in the  _{DataChartName}_ control.

Navigation in the _{GeoMapName}_ control is enabled by default and it allows zooming and panning of the map content. However, this behavior can be changed using the link:{GeoMapLink}.{GeoMapName}~zoomable.html[Zoomable] property. It is important to know that the _{GeoMapName}_ control allows only synchronized zooming - scaling the map content with preserved aspect ratio. As result, it is not possible to scale the map content vertically without scaling it also horizontally and vice versa.

[[_Ref320573152]]
== Map Navigation Window

In the _{GeoMapName}_ control, navigation window represents currently viewable area of the map content. The link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property tracks position and size of the navigation window. Each time panning or zooming operation is performed in the _{GeoMapName}_ control, the navigation window changes and the link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property is updated with new values.

The following table summarizes properties used to track navigation window in the _{GeoMapName}_ control:

|====
|Property|Type|Description|Default Value

| link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect]
| {ApiRectClass}
|Indicates position and size of the navigation window which indicates currently viewable area of the map content in the _{GeoMapName}_ control.
|0, 0, 1, 1 

Displays the entire map content in the navigation window.

| link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~actualwindowpositionhorizontal.html[ActualWindowPositionHorizontal]
|double
|Indicates horizontal position of the navigation window’s anchor point from the left edge of the _{GeoMapName}_ control. It is equivalent to value stored in the Left of the link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property.
|0 

Displays the left portion of the map content in the navigation window.

| link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~actualwindowpositionvertical.html[ActualWindowPositionVertical]
|double
|Indicates vertical position of the navigation window’s anchor point from the top edge of the _{GeoMapName}_ control. It is equivalent to value stored in the Top of the link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property.
|0 

Displays the top portion of the map content in the navigation window.

| link:{GeoMapLink}.{GeoMapName}~actualwindowscale.html[ActualWindowScale]
|double
|Indicates size of the navigation window in of the _{GeoMapName}_ control. It is equivalent to value stored in the link:{DataChartLinkBase}.seriesviewer~actualwindowrect.html[ActualWindowRect] property.
|1 

Displays the entire horizontal map content in the navigation window.
