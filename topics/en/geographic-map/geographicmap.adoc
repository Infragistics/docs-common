| *Feature* | *Description* 

|<<_Ref321151536,Geographic Imagery Maps>>
|Provides rendering geographic imagery from, Azure Maps™, Bing Maps™ pick:[wpf=","] pick:[win-forms=" and"] Open Street Maps pick:[wpf=", and ArcGIS Maps"]. pick:[wpf=" Also, it supports creation of maps from other geographic imagery sources such as Map Quest©."]

|<<_Ref321151541,Geographic Series>>
|Provides rendering of an unlimited number of geographic series that can display geo-spatial data as points, polylines, and polygons. Multiple geographic series can be used to create a complex layering of map elements; e.g. states, cities, and roads.

|<<_Ref321151550,Shape File Converter>>
|Provides loading geo-spatial data from shape files and converting it to data models that can be bound to geographic series as items sources.

|<<_Ref321151553,Data Binding>>
|Provides data binding to other data sources with geographic data using the data binding and data mapping properties of geographic series.

|<<_Ref321151558,High Performance Rendering>>

=== Geographic Imagery Maps

[NOTE]
As of June 30, 2025 all Microsoft Bing Maps for Enterprise Basic (Free) accounts will be retired. If you're still using an unpaid Basic Account and key, now is the time to act to avoid service disruptions. Bing Maps for Enterprise license holders can continue to use Bing Maps in their applications until June 30,2028.

=== Geographic Series

The _{GeoMapName}_ control’s link:{DataChartLinkBase}.{DataChartBase}~series.html[Series] property is used to support rendering an unlimited number of geographic series. This property is a collection of geographic series objects and any type of geographic series can be added to it. For example, link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicsymbolseries_members.html[GeographicSymbolSeries] can be added for plotting geographic locations such as cities and the link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicpolylineseries_members.html[GeographicPolylineSeries] for plotting connections (e.g. roads) between these geographic locations.

=== Shape File Converter

In the _{GeoMapName}_ control, the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] class loads geo-spatial data from shape files and converts it to a collection of link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefilerecord_members.html[ShapefileRecord] objects. Geographic series can be bound to this collection and render geo-spatial data.

=== Data Binding

In addition to rendering data from shape files and geographic imagery maps, the _{GeoMapName}_ control also provides data binding to other data sources with geographic data using the data binding and data mapping properties of geographic series.

The following is a preview of the _{GeoMapName}_ control with link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicsymbolseries_members.html[GeographicSymbolSeries] bound to a data model that contains locations of some cities of the world.

=== High Performance Rendering

The _{GeoMapName}_ control provides plotting of tens of thousands of data points, and updates them every few milliseconds so that the control can handle your real-time feeds.

The following is a preview of the _{GeoMapName}_ control with link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicsymbolseries_members.html[GeographicSymbolSeries] bound to a data source with hundreds of data points.
