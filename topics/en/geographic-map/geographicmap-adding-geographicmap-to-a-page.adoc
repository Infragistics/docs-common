== Adding {GeoMapName} to a Page

[[_Ref320185129]]

=== Introduction

The _{GeoMapName}_ control is designed to display geo-spatial data from shape files and geographic locations from view models on geographic imagery maps. However, this topic focuses on adding the _{GeoMapName}_ control with the minimum code and property settings required for display. By default the _{GeoMapName}_ control is displayed with geographic imagery tiles from Open Street Map service.

[[_Ref320186496]]

=== Preview

The following is a preview of the _{GeoMapName}_ control with geographic imagery tiles from Open Street Map service.

=== Requirements

The following table summarizes the requirements for adding the _{GeoMapName}_ control.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
| *Requirement* | *Description* 

|Prerequisites
|To complete the procedure section of this topic, you need to create a {PlatformName} project.

|Data
|The _{GeoMapName}_ control does not require any data for its rendering because it displays geographic imagery tiles from Open Street Map in its background content. However, the _{GeoMapName}_ control can also display geo-spatial data from shape files and geographic locations from view models. Refer to the following topics for more information on how this is accomplished and for data requirements:

=== Overview

The following is a conceptual overview of the process:

[start=1]
. *Reference Infragistics assemblies in your project* 
[start=2]
. *Add Infragistics namespaces to your application's view* 
[start=3]
. *Add the Geographic Map control to your application's view* 
[start=4]
. *Verify the results* 

[[_Ref320186502]]

=== Steps

The following procedure takes you step-by-step toward adding the _{GeoMapName}_ control to a page.

ifdef::wpf[]

=== Reference Infragistics NuGet packages

Add the following Infragistics NuGet package to your application:

** Infragistics.WPF.GeographicMap

For more information on setting up the NuGet feed and adding NuGet packages, you can take a look at the following documentation: link:nuget-feeds.html[NuGet Feeds].

endif::wpf[]

ifdef::win-forms[]

=== Reference Infragistics assemblies in your project.

[start=1]
. Right click on your project and select the Add References… menu item.
[start=2]
. In the Add References dialog, browse to and add the following Infragistics assemblies:
 
* {ApiPlatform}{GeoMapAssembly}{ApiVersion}.dll
* {ApiPlatform}{GeoMapAssemblyBase}{ApiVersion}.dll
* {ApiPlatform}{DataVizAssembly}{ApiVersion}.dll
* {ApiPlatform}Portable.Core{ApiVersion}.dll

endif::win-forms[]


=== Add Infragistics namespaces to your application's view.

In the application page, add the following namespace declarations:

ifdef::wpf[]
*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
xmlns:ig="http://schemas.infragistics.com/xaml"
----
endif::wpf[]

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Imports {GeoMapNamespace}
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
using {GeoMapNamespace};
----

=== Add the Geographic Map control to your application's view.

The following code demonstrates adding the _{GeoMapName}_ control with the minimum code and property settings required for display:

ifdef::wpf[]
*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot">
    <ig:XamGeographicMap x:Name="GeoMap" />
</Grid>
----
endif::wpf[]

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Dim geoMap As New {GeoMapName}()
ifdef::wpf[]
Me.LayoutRoot.Children.Add(geoMap)
endif::wpf[]
ifdef::win-forms[]
Me.Controls.Add(geoMap)
endif::win-forms[]
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
var geoMap = new {GeoMapName}();
ifdef::wpf[]
this.LayoutRoot.Children.Add(geoMap);
endif::wpf[]
ifdef::win-forms[]
this.Controls.Add(geoMap)
endif::win-forms[]
----

=== Verify the results.

Build and run your project to verify the result. If you have implemented the steps correctly, the displayed _{GeoMapName}_ should look like the one in the <<_Ref320186496,Preview>> section above.
