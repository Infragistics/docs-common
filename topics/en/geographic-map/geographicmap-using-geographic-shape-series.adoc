== Geographic Shape Series

[[_Ref320193474]]

=== Overview

In the _{GeoMapName}_ control, the link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseries_members.html[GeographicShapeSeries] is a visual map element that displays geo-spatial data using shape polygons in a geographic context. This type of geographic series is often used to render shapes of countries or regions defined by geographic locations. The link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseries_members.html[GeographicShapeSeries] works a lot like the link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicpolylineseries_members.html[GeographicPolylineSeries] except that geo-spatial data is rendered with polygons instead of polylines.

[[_Ref320651783]]

=== Preview

The following is a preview of the _{GeoMapName}_ control with link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseries_members.html[GeographicShapeSeries] plotting countries of the world.

=== Data Requirements

Similarly to other types of geographic series in the _{GeoMapName}_ control, the link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseries_members.html[GeographicShapeSeries] has the link:{DataChartLink}.series~{ApiDataSource}.html[{ApiDataSource}] property for the purpose of data binding. This property can be bound to an object that implements link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[IEnumerable] interface. In addition, each item in this object must have one data column that stores geographic locations (longitude and latitude) of a shape using the link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[IEnumerable]<pick:[wpf="link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.point.aspx[Point]"]pick:[win-forms"{GeoMapNamespace}.Point"]> or link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[IEnumerable]<link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[IEnumerable]<pick:[wpf="link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.point.aspx[Point]"]pick:[win-forms"{GeoMapNamespace}.Point"]>> structure. The latter is the standard data structure used by shape files and the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] class. This data column is then mapped to the link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseriesbase~shapememberpath.html[ShapeMemberPath] property. The link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseries_members.html[GeographicShapeSeries] uses points of this mapped data column to plot polygons in the _{GeoMapName}_ control.

=== Example

The following code shows how to bind the link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseries_members.html[GeographicShapeSeries] to shapes of countries in the world loaded from a shape file using the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter].

ifdef::wpf[]
*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:ShapefileConverter x:Key="shapefileConverter"
                        ShapefileSource="ShapeFiles/world_countries.shp"
                        DatabaseSource="ShapeFiles/world_countries.dbf" >
</ig:ShapefileConverter>
<ig:XamGeographicMap x:Name="GeoMap">
    <ig:XamGeographicMap.Series>
        <ig:GeographicShapeSeries {ApiDataSource}="{StaticResource shapefileConverter}"
                                   ShapeMemberPath="Points">
        </ig:GeographicShapeSeries>
    </ig:XamGeographicMap.Series>
</ig:XamGeographicMap>
----
endif::wpf[]

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
' create and set data binding to the GeographicShapeSeries
Dim geoSeries = New GeographicShapeSeries()
geoSeries.{ApiDataSource} = shapefileConverter
geoSeries.ShapeMemberPath = "Points"
' add the GeographicShapeSeries to the the {GeoMapName}
Me.GeoMap.Series.Add(geoSeries)
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
// create and set data binding to the GeographicShapeSeries
var geoSeries = new GeographicShapeSeries();
geoSeries.{ApiDataSource} = shapefileConverter;
geoSeries.ShapeMemberPath = "Points";
// add the GeographicShapeSeries to the the {GeoMapName}
this.GeoMap.Series.Add(geoSeries);
