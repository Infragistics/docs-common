== Adding Shape Files to Application

[[_Ref320193474]]

=== Overview

Adding shape files to an application works the same way as adding typically non-executable data files such as image, audio, and video files. As a developer, you have a number of methods for deploying shape files with your application. These methods are explained in the following MSDN topic:

ifdef::sl[]
* link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc296240(v=vs.95).aspx[Deploying Files with SL Application]

endif::sl[]

ifdef::wpf[]
* link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970494.aspx[Deploying Files with WPF Application]
endif::wpf[]

ifdef::win-forms[]
* link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t71a733d(v=vs.140).aspx[Deploying Files with Windows Forms Application - ClickOnce Security and Deployment]
endif::win-forms[]

All shape files should be placed in the same folder in your application.

== Loading Geo-spatial Data from Shape Files

[[_Ref317163220]]

=== Overview

In the _{GeoMapName}_ control, the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] class loads geo-spatial data from shape files and converts it to a collection of link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefilerecord_members.html[ShapefileRecord] objects.

The following table explains properties of the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] class for loading shape files.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|*Property*|*Type*|* Description*

| link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter~shapefilesource.html[ShapefileSource]
|Uri
|Specifies the Uri to a shape file (.shp) that contains geo-spatial data items.

| link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter~databasesource.html[DatabaseSource]
|Uri
|Specifies the Uri to a shape database file (.dbf) that contains a data table for geo-spatial data items.

|====

Both of the source properties for shape files are of Uri type. This means that shape files can be embedded resources in the application assemblypick:[wpf,win-forms=" and"]pick:[sl=","] on the internet (via http)pick:[sl=", or in the XAP file (Silverlight only)"]. Refer to the previous section for more information on this process. The rules for resolving Uri objects are equivalent to any standard Uri property, for example the link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.imaging.bitmapimage.urisource(v=vs.95).aspx[BitmapImage.UriSource] property.

When both source properties are set to non-null values, then the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] object’s ImportAsync method is invoked which in return performs fetching and reading the shape files and finally doing the conversion. After this operation is complete, the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] is populated with link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefilerecord_members.html[ShapefileRecord] objects and the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter~importcompleted_ev.html[ImportCompleted] event is raised in order to notify about completed process of loading and converting geo-spatial data from shape files.

[[_Ref320193492]]

=== Example

The following code creates an instance of the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] object for loading a shape file that contains locations of major cities in the world. It also demonstrates how to handle the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter~importcompleted_ev.html[ImportCompleted] event as a prerequisite for binding data to the _{GeoMapName}_ control.

== Binding Geo-spatial Data to Geographic Series

[[_Ref320193500]]

=== Overview

In the _{GeoMapName}_ control, Geographic Series are used for displaying geo-spatial data that is loaded from shape files. Refer to the link:geographicmap-using-geographic-series.html[Using Geographic Series] topic for overview of supported Geographic Series by the _{GeoMapName}_ control. All types of Geographic Series have an link:{DataChartLink}.series~{ApiDataSource}.html[{ApiDataSource}] property which can be bound to any object that implements the interface (for example: link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19.aspx[List], link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132397.aspx[Collection], link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7977ey2c.aspx[Queue], link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.stack.aspx[Stack]). The link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] is another example of Enumerable object because it implements a collection of link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefilerecord_members.html[ShapefileRecord] objects.

The link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefilerecord_members.html[ShapefileRecord] class provides properties for storing geo-spatial data, listed in the following table.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|*Property*|*Type*|* Description*

| link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefilerecord~points.html[Points]
| link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19(v=VS.80).aspx[List]<link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19(v=VS.80).aspx[List]<pick:[wfp="link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.point(v=VS.95).aspx[Point]"]pick:[win-forms="{GeoMapNamespace}.Point"]>>
|Contains all the points in one geo-spatial shape loaded from a shape file (.shp). For example, the country of Japan in shape file would be represented as a List of a List of points object, where: 

* The first list of points describes shape of Hokkaido island 

* The second list of points describes shape of Honshu island 

* The third list of points describes shape of Kyushu island 

* The fourth list of points describes shape of Shikoku island 

And so on until all shapes/states/islands of a country are represented.

| link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefilerecord~fields.html[Fields]
| link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xfhwa508(v=vs.80).aspx[Dictionary]<link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string(v=vs.80).aspx[String], link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object(v=vs.80).aspx[Object]>
|Contains a row of data from the shape database file (.dbf) keyed by a column name. For example, a data about county of Japan which includes population, area, name of a capital, etc.

|====

This data structure is suitable for use in most Geographic Series as long as appropriate data columns are mapped to them.

The following topics explain in detail binding and data requirements for each type of Geographic Series:

[[_Ref320218367]]

=== Example

This code example assumes that shape files were loaded using the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] as it is explained in the <<_Ref320193469,Adding Shape Files to Application>> section of this topic.

The following code binds link:{GeoMapLink}.geographicshapeseries_members.html[GeographicShapeSeries] in the {GeoMapName} control to the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefileconverter_members.html[ShapefileConverter] and maps the link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefilerecord~points.html[Points] property of all link:{DataVizMapsLink}.shapefilerecord_members.html[ShapefileRecord] objects.
