[[PreparingProject]]
=== Preparing Project

[start=1]
. Create a new class file in your project and name it SampleSalesPerson; this class will be used to generate sample data.

[start=2]
. Replace content of your SampleSalesPerson class file with the source code from the link:SampleSalesPerson.html[SampleSalesPerson] resource.

[start=3]
. Import the following namespace to your view:

ifdef::android[]
*In Java:*
[source, java]
----
import com.infragistics.controls.*;
----
endif::android[]

ifdef::xamarin[]
*In XAML:*
[source, xaml]
----
xmlns:grids="clr-namespace:Infragistics.XamarinForms.Controls.Grids;assembly=Infragistics.XF.DataGrid"
xmlns:local="clr-namespace:Infragistics.Data;assembly=YourAppName" 
----
endif::xamarin[]

ifdef::xaml[]
*In C#:*
[source, csharp]
----
using {DataGridNamespace};
using Infragistics.Data;
----
endif::xaml[]

[[CreatingControl]]
=== Creating the {DataGridName}

Create an instance of the {DataGridName} control within the main view, and use its 
link:{DataGridLink}.{DataGridName}~{ApiDataSource}.html[{ApiDataSource}] {ApiMember} to populate it with sample data as demonstrated in the following sample code.

ifdef::android[]
*In Java:* 
[source, java]
----  
{DataGridName} DataGrid = new {DataGridName}(this);
DataGrid.setDataSource(SampleSalesPerson.GenerateSalesData(100)); 
----
endif::android[]

ifdef::xaml[]
*In XAML:*
[source, xaml]
----
<grids:XamDataGrid x:Name="DataGrid" >
    <grids:XamDataGrid.ItemsSource>
        <local:SampleSalesTeam />
    </grids:XamDataGrid.ItemsSource>          
</grids:XamDataGrid>
----
endif::xaml[]

ifdef::xaml[]
*In C#:*
[source, csharp]
----
var DataGrid = new {DataGridName}();
DataGrid.ItemsSource = SampleSalesPerson.GenerateSalesData(100);
----
endif::xaml[]

[[VerifyResults]]
=== Verify Results

Save and run your application to verify the result, it should appear similar, (barring differences in screen orientation and resolution) to the screenshot below.
