== Overview

The {DataGridName} control allows you to sort records of a link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Column]; the associated content of the remaining columns will be sorted accordingly and then the aggregate of these sorted records is displayed on the UI of the {DataGridName} control. Sorting can be implemented on Local and Remote data sources; for more information, refer to the following topics:

* link:datagrid-binding-remote-data-source.html[Binding Remote Data Source]
* link:datagrid-binding-local-data-source.html[Binding Local Data Source]

The following steps demonstrate how to implement sorting:

== {DataGridLinkBase}.ListSortDirection

[start=1]
. Bind the {DataGridName} control to data.
[start=2]
. Creating a new instance of the link:{DataGridLink}.ColumnSortDescription.html[ColumnSortDescription] class, passing as its parameters the pick:[android="key"]pick:[xaml="`PropertyPath`"] of the link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Column] that you are interested in sorting as well as the desired link:{DataGridLinkBase}.ListSortDirection.html[ListSortDirection], (ascending or descending).
[start=3]
. Add the `ColumnSortDescription` object to the {DataGridName} control's link:{DataGridLink}.ColumnSortDescriptionCollection.html[ColumnSortDescriptionCollection] collection.

[[_Ref441830703]]
== Column Sort Descriptions

A link:{DataGridLink}.ColumnSortDescription.html[ColumnSortDescription] object is used to tell the {DataGridName} control how it should sort its records; each `ColumnSortDescription` is responsible for a single sorting behavior, (for example, the LastName link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Column] should be sorted with an Ascending order). Multiple `ColumnSortDescription` objects may be assigned to the {DataGridName} control simultaneously to achieve even more complex sorting behaviors, (for more information, see the <<_Ref441830728,Example Sorting Records of Multiple Columns:>>).

The {DataGridName} control determines how it should sort its records by iterating through the `ColumnSortDescription` objects, (if any) within its link:{DataGridLink}.ColumnSortDescriptionCollection.html[ColumnSortDescriptionCollection] collection. If no `ColumnSortDescription` objects are present, the {DataGridName} control will persist the original record order of its underlying link:{DataGridLink}.{DataGridName}{ApiProp}{ApiDatasource}.html[{ApiDataSource}].

Each `ColumnSortDescription` object is assigned a property on the {DataGridName} control's {ApiDataSource}, (for example, such as a public property associated with a link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Column]) whose records will be sorted, as well as a `ColumnSortDescription`, which indicates the sorting direction to be applied to the column records, (either ascending or descending).


[[_Ref441830710]]
== Sorting Records of Single Column

The following example demonstrates how to implement a basic sorting behavior. In this scenario, the {DataGridName} control is bound to data containing three link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Columns] : FirstName, LastName, and Territory; with an ascending sort order applied to the LastName link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Column].


This code snippets creates an instance of the link:{DataGridLink}.ColumnSortDescription.html[ColumnSortDescription] class, with the pick:[android="key"]pick:[xaml="`PropertyPath`"] of the LastName link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Column] and it uses the link:{DataGridLinkBase}.ListSortDirection.html[ListSortDirection] enumeration to pass in an ascending sort order. Then it adds the `ColumnSortDescription` object to a link:{DataGridLink}.ColumnSortDescriptionCollection.html[ColumnSortDescriptionCollection] collection off of the {DataGridName} control, using its link:{DataGridLink}.{DataGridName}{ApiPropGet}SortDescriptions.html[pick:[android="set"]SortDescriptions] {ApiMember}.

ifdef::android[]
*In Java:*

[source, java]
----
SortDescription nameSortDescription = new SortDescription("LastName", SortDirection.ASCENDING);
DataGrid.getSortDescriptions().add(nameSortDescription);
----
endif::android[]

ifdef::xaml[]
*In C#:*
[source, csharp]
----
var description = new ColumnSortDescription("LastName", ListSortDirection.Ascending);
DataGrid.SortDescriptions.Add(description);
----
endif::xaml[]
 
The following screenshot illustrates the resulting sort behavior, note that records within the LastName link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Column] are sorted in an ascending order, with all other associated records being sorted accordingly.

[[_Ref441830728]]
== Sorting Records of Multiple Columns

Multiple link:{DataGridLink}.ColumnSortDescription.html[ColumnSortDescription] objects may be applied simultaneously to the {DataGridName} control. In such a circumstance, the {DataGridName} control will attempt to reconcile its sort conditions by performing a sync operation for its assigned link:{DataGridLink}.ColumnSortDescriptionCollection.html[ColumnSortDescriptionCollection]. This process involves the {DataGridName} control iterating through its `ColumnSortDescriptionCollection` collection and will prioritizing the sorting behavior of each `ColumnSortDescription` based on the order that it is present in the collection, (item[0] executed first, item[1] executed second, etc). In this way, multi-column sorting is possible, wherein data may be sorted into groups, which are also sorted.

This multi-sort behavior is demonstrated in the following example.

In this scenario, two `ColumnSortDescription` objects have been applied to the {DataGridName} control; the primary `ColumnSortDescription` targets the Territory link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Column] and sorts in an ascending order, the second targets the LastName `Column` and also sorts in an ascending order. Using this combination of `ColumnSortDescription` objects, a pseudo grouping behavior is achieved, where the names of individuals assigned to a given territory are grouped by that territory, (the list of which is sorted in an ascending order) and each group of individuals is also listed in an ascending order.
 
ifdef::android[]
*In Java:*

[source, java]
----
SortDescription sorting1 = new SortDescription("Territory”, SortDirection.ASCENDING);
SortDescription sorting2 = new SortDescription("LastName”, SortDirection.ASCENDING);

DataGrid.getSortDescriptions().add(sorting1);
DataGrid.getSortDescriptions().add(sorting2);
----
endif::android[]

ifdef::xaml[]
*In C#:*
[source, csharp]
----
var sorting1 = new ColumnSortDescription("Territory", ListSortDirection.Ascending);
var sorting2 = new ColumnSortDescription("LastName", ListSortDirection.Ascending);

DataGrid.SortDescriptions.Add(sorting1);
DataGrid.SortDescriptions.Add(sorting2);
----
endif::xaml[]


The following screenshot illustrates the resulting sort behavior on the Territory and LastName Columns.

Note that the Territory link:{DataGridLink}.Column_members.html[Column] has been sorted first, in an ascending order followed by the LastName column which is also sorted in an ascending order. The {DataGridName} control has synced these sorting operations, so that both conditions are satisfied, (with the order that the link:{DataGridLink}.ColumnSortDescription.html[ColumnSortDescription] are executed in indicating their priority). In this way, all data items assigned to a territory are grouped by that territory and each group of item is also sorted in an ascending order.
