This unique toolbox loads Infragistics Xamarin.Forms controls from NuGet Packages installed the project. 

When a XAML page is made active in the Visual Studio editor, Infragistics NuGet Packages for Xamarin.Forms controls that are installed in the project will appear in the Toolbox.

[[ShowingToolbox]]
== Showing the Infragistics Toolbox

After installing the Infragistics Toolbox open Visual Studio, select the “View” menu, select the “Other Windows” menu option, and then select “Infragistics Toolbox,” to show the Toolbox.
 
The Toolbox will not render any control items until you open a Xamarin.Forms project and then open a XAML file.
 
If you have added one or more Infragistics Xamarin.Forms controls NuGet packages to the project the XAML file belongs too, Infragistics controls belonging to those NuGet packages will have items displayed in the Toolbox along with the standard Xamarin.Forms controls.
 
If you have not added one or more Infragistics Xamarin.Forms controls NuGet packages to the project the XAML file belongs too, no Infragistics controls will be displayed in the Toolbox.  However, the standard Xamarin.Forms controls will have items displayed.
