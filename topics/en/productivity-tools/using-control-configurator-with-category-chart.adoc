[[Introduction]]
== Introduction

The Category Chart Control Configurator is a visual tool that enables the developer to very quickly visually configure an Infragistics {PlatformName} {CategoryChartName} control with a real-time preview of the control as it is being configured. The preview is close to how it will appear at runtime on the mobile device.

Real-time sample data is created after data binding the ItemsSource property of the chart. This sample data inflates the Category Chart on the configurator layout surface using the types in your project.
