[[Introduction]]
== Introduction
 
Control Configurators are visual tools that enable the developer to very quickly visually configure an Infragistics {PlatformName} control with a real-time preview of the control as it is being configured. The preview is close to how it will appear at runtime on the mobile device.

[[WhyUse]]
== Why Use a Control Configurator?

Control Configurators enable the developer to:

- Quickly configure the target control using a Quick Set (applies to gauges).
- Visually  configure a control using gallery items with preview images.
- Learn and master the feature rich Infragistics {PlatformName} controls using the property grid that is categorized by feature, making it very easy to focus on one aspect of the control at a time.

After using the Control Configurators for a short time, you’ll be an expert in configuring the rich Infragistics {PlatformName} controls.

[[Features]]
== Features

The features are common to all Control Configurators.

- Quick Sets (gauges only) enable instantly configuring a control by selecting a pre-configured control from the Quick Sets Ribbon Gallery.
- Brushes and Outlines enable selecting a set of brushes or outlines. The number of colors in a set of brushes or outlines are dynamically determined by the target they will be applied to. If 4 are required 4 will be displayed, if 7, 7 will be displayed. 
- Control Configurators enable developers to configure a control using the same background color that it will be rendered on at runtime.
- Brushes and Outlines in the Gallery can be rendered using the configurator background color if desired.  This makes it real easy to see how a set of brushes will look on a background color.
- A control bounding box outline is provided to show the developer the control’s size relative to the area provided by the parent layout control.
- The Data Binding Builder is a visual tool for creating data bindings.
- Design-Time Data allows the developer to set values and see the control respond to those values.
- The Resource Selector allows assigning a resource defined in App.xaml or the local page to a property on the control.
- Rich property grid for setting, inspecting, data binding, setting resources, or resetting property values.
- Ribbon button has links to {PlatformName} controls and configurator help documents.
