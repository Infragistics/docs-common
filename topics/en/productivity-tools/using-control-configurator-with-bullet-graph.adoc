[[Introduction]]
== Introduction 

The Bullet Graph Control Configurator is a visual tool that enables the developer to very quickly visually configure an Infragistics {PlatformName} {BulletGraphName} control with a real-time preview of the control as it is being configured. The preview is close to how it will appear at runtime on the mobile device.
