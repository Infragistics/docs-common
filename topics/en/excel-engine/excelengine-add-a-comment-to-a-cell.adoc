= Adding a Comment to a Cell ({ExcelEngineName})

A comment allows you to display hints or notes for a cellpick:[wpf=" when the end user's mouse hovers over a cell"]. The comments display as a tooltip-like callout that contains text. The {ExcelEngineName} allows you to add comments to a cell by setting a link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheetcell.html[WorksheetCell] object’s link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheetcell~comment.html[Comment] property.
