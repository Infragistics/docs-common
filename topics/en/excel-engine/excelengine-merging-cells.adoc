= Merging Cells ({ExcelEngineName})

Aside from setting the value or format of cells, you can also merge cells to make two or more cells appear as one. If you merge cells, they must be in a rectangular region. When you merge cells, each cell in the region will have the same value and cell format. The merged cells will also be associated with the same link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheetmergedcellsregion.html[WorksheetMergedCellsRegion] object, accessible from their AssociatedMergedCellsRegion property. The WorksheetMergedCellsRegion object will also have the same value and cell format as the cells. Setting the value (or cell format) of the region or any cell in the region will change the value of all cells and the region. If you unmerge cells, all of the previously merged cells will retain the shared cell format they had before they were unmerged. However, only the top-left cell of the region will retain the shared value.

In order to create a merged cell region, you must add a range of cells to the link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheet.html[Worksheet] object's link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheet~mergedcellsregions.html[MergedCellsRegions] collection. The MergedCellsRegions collection exposes an link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheetmergedcellsregioncollection~add.html[Add] method that takes four integer parameters. The four parameters determine the index of the starting row and column (top-left most cell) and the index of the ending row and column (bottom-right most cell).

The following example demonstrates how to merge cells.

ifdef::asp-net,aspnet-old,win-forms,win-forms-old,wpf[]
*In Visual Basic:*
[source,vb]
----
Imports Infragistics.Documents.Excel
...
Dim workbook1 As New Workbook()
Dim worksheet As Worksheet = workbook1.Worksheets.Add("Sheet1")
' Add column headers
worksheet.Rows(1).Cells(1).Value = "Morning"
worksheet.Rows(1).Cells(2).Value = "Afternoon"
worksheet.Rows(1).Cells(3).Value = "Evening"
' Create a merged region from column 1 to column 3 that will be a header to the column headers
Dim mergedRegion1 As WorksheetMergedCellsRegion = worksheet.MergedCellsRegions.Add(0, 1, 0, 3)
' Set the value of the merged region
mergedRegion1.Value = "Day 1"
' Set the cell alignment of the middle cell in the merged region.
' Since a cell and its merged region shared a cell format, this will 
' ultimately set the format of the merged region
worksheet.Rows(0).Cells(2).CellFormat.Alignment = HorizontalCellAlignment.Center

endif::asp-net,aspnet-old,win-forms,win-forms-old,wpf[]

*In C#:*
[source,csharp]
----
using Infragistics.Documents.Excel;
...
Workbook workbook1 = new Workbook();
Worksheet worksheet = workbook1.Worksheets.Add("Sheet1");
// Make some column headers
worksheet.Rows[1].Cells[1].Value = "Morning";
worksheet.Rows[1].Cells[2].Value = "Afternoon";
worksheet.Rows[1].Cells[3].Value = "Evening";
// Create a merged region from column 1 to column 3 that will be a header to the column headers
WorksheetMergedCellsRegion mergedRegion1 =  worksheet.MergedCellsRegions.Add(0, 1, 0, 3);
// Set the value of the merged region
mergedRegion1.Value = "Day 1";
// Set the cell alignment of the middle cell in the merged region.
// Since a cell and its merged region shared a cell format, this will 
// ultimately set the format of the merged region
worksheet.Rows[0].Cells[2].CellFormat.Alignment = HorizontalCellAlignment.Center;
