== Adding a Table to a Worksheet

=== Introduction

The worksheet tables are a related data in the worksheet formatted in rows and columns. The data in a worksheet table can be managed independently from the data in the other rows and columns of the worksheet. Worksheet tables in the {ExcelEngineName} are represented by the link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable.html[WorksheetTable] class and are added in the worksheet's link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheet~tables.html[Tables] collection. This procedure demonstrates how to add a worksheet table to a worksheet.

=== Prerequisites

To complete the procedure, you need the following:

An initialized workbook with at least one worksheet named "ws".

=== Overview

Following is a conceptual overview of the process:

1. Invoke the Add method of the Worksheet’s Tables collection

2. Specify table’s region

3. Specify if the table data contains headers

4. Specify table’s style (optional)

=== Steps

The following steps demonstrate how to add a table to a worksheet.

=== 1. Invoke the Add method of the Worksheet’s Tables collection

Invoke the link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettablecollection~add.html[Add] method of the Worksheet’s `Tables` collection. The next steps provide more information regarding the method’s arguments.

=== 2. Specify table’s region

As first argument specify the region which should be occupied by the table. For example: "F16:T29". If your data have headers include the header cells in the region too.

=== 3. Specify if the table data contains headers

As second argument specify if the specified region contains cells which should be used as table headers. Set this argument to `true` if there are header cells in the region.

=== 4. Specify table’s style (optional)

As third and optional argument you can specify a link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettablestyle.html[WorksheetTableStyle] object to apply on the table.

[[_Ref382317785]]

=== Full code

The following code demonstrates how to add a worksheet table (which occupies the region "F16:T29" and has header cells in the top cells of this region) to the `Tables` collection of a worksheet named "ws".

ifdef::asp-net,aspnet-old,win-forms,win-forms-old,wpf[]
*In Visual Basic:*
[source,vb]
----
Dim wt As WorksheetTable = Me.ws.Tables.Add("F16:T29", True)
----
endif::asp-net,aspnet-old,win-forms,win-forms-old,wpf[]

*In C#:*
[source,csharp]
----
WorksheetTable wt = this.ws.Tables.Add("F16:T29", true);
----

.Note
[NOTE]
====
You can use the reference returned by the `Add` method to operate with the worksheet table. For example you may set a table name, obtain its regions or provide sort settings.

== Alter Table Columns and Rows

The following table explains briefly the altering operations you may perform over the columns and rows of a worksheet table and maps them to the methods that configure them.

|Altering operation
|Details
|Method

|Insert column(s)
|This method is used to insert one or more column(s).
| link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable~insertcolumns(int32,int32).html[InsertColumns]

|Insert data row(s)
|This method is used to insert one or more data row(s)
| link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable~insertdatarows.html[InsertDataRows]

|Delete column(s)
|This method is used to delete one or more column(s)
| link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable~deletecolumns.html[DeleteColumns]

|Delete data row(s)
|This method is used to delete one or more data row(s).
| link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable~deletedatarows.html[DeleteDataRows]

|Set new table range
|This method is used to assign a new cells' region to a `WorksheetTable` object. For example if you have a `WorksheetTable` object assigned to the cells' region C26:G32 you can reassign the `WorksheetTable` object to cells' region J6:O15 by invoking: 

ifdef::asp-net,aspnet-old,win-forms,win-forms-old,wpf[]
*In Visual Basic:*
[source,vb]
---- 
worksheetTable.Resize("J6:O15")
---- 
endif::asp-net,aspnet-old,win-forms,win-forms-old,wpf[]

*In C#:*
[source,csharp]
---- 
worksheetTable.Resize("J6:O15");
---- 

The cells' region at location C26:G32 will retain their content and styling, but will not be associated with the `WorksheetTable` object any more.
