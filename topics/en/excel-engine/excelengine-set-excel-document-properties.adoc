= Setting Workbook Properties ({ExcelEngineName})

Microsoft® Excel® document properties provide information to help organize and keep track of your documents. You can use the {ExcelEngineName} to set these properties using the link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.workbook.html[Workbook] object’s link:{ExcelEngineApiLink}infragistics.documents.excel.workbook~documentproperties.html[DocumentProperties] property. The available properties are:

* Author
* Title
* Subject
* Keywords
* Category
* Status
* Comments
* Company
* Manager

The following code demonstrates how to create a workbook and set its Title and Status document properties.

ifdef::asp-net,aspnet-old,win-forms,win-forms-old,wpf[]
*In Visual Basic:*
[source, vb]
----
Imports Infragistics.Documents.Excel
...
Dim workbook As New Workbook()
workbook.DocumentProperties.Title = "Expense Report"
workbook.DocumentProperties.Status = "Complete"
----
endif::asp-net,aspnet-old,win-forms,win-forms-old,wpf[]

*In C#:*
[source, csharp]
----
using Infragistics.Documents.Excel;
...
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
workbook.DocumentProperties.Title = "Expense Report";
workbook.DocumentProperties.Status = "Complete";
----
