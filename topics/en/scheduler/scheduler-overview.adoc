= Overview ({SchedulerName})

The {SchedulerName} control provides a common scheduling solution for presenting and managing time periods and the associated activities.

The control itself is represented by the link:{SchedulerXFLink}.xamscheduler.html[{SchedulerClassName}] class which can be configured to visualize different views. The views are switched using the link:{SchedulerXFLink}.xamscheduler~viewmode.html[ViewMode] property which should be set to a value of type link:{SchedulerCoreLink}.core.schedulerviewmode.html[SchedulerViewMode]. By default the control renders a month view with an integrated agenda view which shows only the appointments for the selected day.

The following screenshots show the views provided by the control:

More information regarding each view can be found under the link:scheduler-views.html[Views] section.
