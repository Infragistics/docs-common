== Overview

The agenda view of the {SchedulerName} is visualizing the activities which occur during a specific time range. The time range is specified using the link:{SchedulerXFLink}.xamscheduler~agendaviewminimumdate.html[AgendaViewMinimumDate] and link:{SchedulerXFLink}.xamscheduler~agendaviewmaximumdate.html[AgendaViewMaximumDate] properties. The activities are presented in the agenda view with their subject, location and times. If an activity has a resource associated with it and the resource has a color scheme set, this color will be used for drawing the vertical separator between the activity's time and activity's subject.

The following image shows the agenda view along with its visual elements:

== Styling

The agenda view is highly configurable in terms of fonts, sizes and colors. There are a lot of properties at your disposal to configure this view and all of their names are prefixed with *AgendaView* so that it is easier for you to find them. For example:

* The properties for controlling the foreground and background colors are of type `Brush`. For example: link:{SchedulerXFLink}.xamscheduler~agendaviewbackgroundbrush.html[AgendaViewBackgroundBrush] or link:{SchedulerXFLink}.xamscheduler~agendaviewappointmentsubjecttextbrush.html[AgendaViewAppointmentSubjectTextBrush].

* The properties for controlling the font sizes are of type `double`. For example: link:{SchedulerXFLink}.xamscheduler~agendaviewappointmentsubjectfontsize.html[AgendaViewAppointmentSubjectFontSize].

* The properties for controlling the font family are of type `string`. For example: link:{SchedulerXFLink}.xamscheduler~agendaviewappointmentsubjectfontfamily.html[AgendaViewAppointmentSubjectFontFamily].

* The properties for controlling the font styling are of type `FontAttributes`. For example: link:{SchedulerXFLink}.xamscheduler~agendaviewappointmentsubjectfontattributes.html[AgendaViewAppointmentSubjectFontAttributes]
