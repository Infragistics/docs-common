== Overview

The day view of the {SchedulerName} is visualizing the activities by rendering them in a vertical list with time slots. The time slots' duration can be configured. Each activity occupies only the time slots between its start and end time. If there are two (or more) activities occupying the same time slot they are rendered side by side.

This view has the ability to show up to 7 days which are also rendered side by side. The top part of the day view contains a navigation header which shows the currently selected days and also allows the user to navigate to the previous or the next group of days. The bottom part contains time slots' hours on the left and the activities on the right organized in columns (one for each day).

You can configure the day view to display all 24 hours or only the working hours.

The following image shows the day view, configured to display three days:
