== Overview

When you have an activity which occupies an entire day or days you can use the "all-day" feature of the activities. To define an activity as all-day you have to set its link:{SchedulerCoreLink}.activitybase~isallDay.html[IsAllDay] property to `true`. In this case the activity will start at midnight on its start date until midnight of the day following the end date.

All available {SchedulerName} views are supporting all-day activities, however there are some differences in the way they are visualized.

* The month view renders all-day activities like any other activity.

* The agenda view renders all-day activities on top of the activities list for each day and with the text "all-day" at the time constrains slot: +

* The day view renders all-day activities in a special all-day activities area on top of all activities with no information in the time slot area. +

* The week view renders all-day activities in a special all-day activities area on top of all activities with no information in the time slot area. +

Appointment appointment1 = new Appointment();
appointment1.Subject = "Anniversary";
appointment1.Location = "Restaurant";
appointment1.Start = new DateTime(DateTime.Today.Year, DateTime.Today.Month, DateTime.Today.Day);
appointment1.End = new DateTime(DateTime.Today.Year, DateTime.Today.Month, DateTime.Today.Day);
appointment1.IsAllDay = true;
