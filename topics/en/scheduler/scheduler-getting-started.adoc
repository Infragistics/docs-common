== Steps

ifdef::xamarin[]
. Create a Xamarin.Forms application project.

. link:xamarin-project-with-infragistics-controls.html#NuGetPackages[Add References Through NuGet Packages].

. Create new Forms Content Page Xaml

. In the page XAML add the following namespace:
+
*In XAML:*
+
[source,xaml]
----
xmlns:igScheduler="clr-namespace:Infragistics.XamarinForms.Controls.Scheduler;assembly=Infragistics.XF.Scheduler"
----

. Add the {SchedulerName} definition in the content grid:
+
*In XAML:*
+
[source,xaml]
----
<Grid>
    <igScheduler:XamScheduler x:Name="scheduler" />
</Grid>
----

. Open the page's code-behind and add the following namespace:
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
using Infragistics.Scheduler;
using Infragistics.XamarinForms.Controls.Scheduler;
----

. Create a private method for populating the {SchedulerName}'s activities:
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
private void PopulateActivities()
{
    DateTime today = DateTime.Now.Date;

    // Create an appointment
    Appointment appointment1 = new Appointment();
    appointment1.Subject = "Team Meeting";
    appointment1.Location = "Conf. Room #3";
    appointment1.Start = new DateTime(today.Year, today.Month, today.Day, 10, 0, 0);
    appointment1.End = new DateTime(today.Year, today.Month, today.Day, 10, 30, 0);
    
    
    // Create a list of appointment
    ObservableCollection<Appointment> appointments = new ObservableCollection<Appointment>();
    appointments.Add(appointment1);

    // Create a ScheduleListDataSource instance
    ScheduleListDataSource dataSource = new ScheduleListDataSource();
    dataSource.AppointmentItemsSource = appointments;

    // Set the data source to the control
    this.scheduler.DataSource = dataSource;
}
----

. Invoke the method defined in the previous step just after the InitializeComponent() invocation in the page's constructor.
+
*In C#:*
+
[source,csharp]
----
PopulateActivities();
----

. Build, deploy and run your application.
