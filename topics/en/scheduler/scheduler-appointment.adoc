== Overview

The activities are used to represent an event which starts at a specific time and ends at a specific time. These activities are represented by the link:{SchedulerCoreLink}.appointment.html[Appointment] type which derives from the abstract base link:{SchedulerCoreLink}.activitybase.html[ActivityBase] type and encapsulate all the associated information with this event.

Activities occur during a range of time with a duration of several hours, several days or even more.
