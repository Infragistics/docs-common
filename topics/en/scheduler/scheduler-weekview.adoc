== Overview

Just like the day view, the week view of the {SchedulerName} is visualizing the activities by rendering them in a vertical list with time slots. The difference is that you can configure the view to show all 7 week days or only the working days.

You can configure the week view to display all 24 hours or only the working hours.

The following image shows the week view along with its visual elements:
